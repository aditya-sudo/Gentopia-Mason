INFO:root:It seems that I couldn't find a specific guided meditation exercise at the moment. However, I can provide you with a simple guided meditation script that you can follow during your break:

### Guided Meditation for Work Break

1. **Find a Comfortable Position**: Sit in a comfortable chair with your feet flat on the ground. Rest your hands on your lap or on the table in front of you.

2. **Close Your Eyes**: Gently close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs completely.

3. **Exhale Slowly**: Exhale slowly through your mouth, letting go of any tension in your body. Repeat this deep breathing for a few cycles.

4. **Focus on Your Breath**: Now, allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm. Focus your attention on the sensation of your breath entering and leaving your body.

5. **Body Scan**: Starting from the top of your head, slowly bring your awareness down through your body. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort. As you exhale, imagine releasing that tension.

6. **Visualize Calmness**: Picture a peaceful scene, such as a beach or a quiet forest. Imagine the sounds, smells, and sensations of this place. Allow yourself to feel calm and relaxed.

7. **Affirmation**: Silently repeat a positive affirmation, such as "I am calm and focused" or "I am capable and strong."

8. **Return to the Present**: After a few minutes, gently bring your awareness back to the room. Wiggle your fingers and toes, and when you're ready, open your eyes.

9. **Reflect**: Take a moment to notice how you feel. Carry this sense of calm with you as you return to your work.

Feel free to adjust the duration of each step based on your available time. Enjoy your break!

INFO:root:Here's a guided meditation script that you can follow for a 10-minute session during your break:

---

**Guided Meditation for Relaxation (10 Minutes)**

*Begin by finding a comfortable seated position. You can sit in a chair with your feet flat on the ground or cross-legged on the floor. Allow your hands to rest gently on your knees or in your lap. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable doing so.*

**Minute 1: Centering Yourself**
Take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs completely. Hold it for a moment. Now, exhale slowly through your mouth, letting go of any tension. Repeat this deep breathing two more times, inhaling deeply and exhaling fully.

**Minute 2: Body Awareness**
Now, bring your attention to your body. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort. As you breathe in, imagine sending your breath to those areas. As you exhale, visualize the tension melting away. 

**Minute 3: Focus on Your Breath**
Shift your focus to your breath. Notice the natural rhythm of your breathing. Feel the cool air entering your nostrils and the warm air leaving. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your focus back to your breath.

**Minute 4: Visualization**
Now, imagine a peaceful place. It could be a beach, a forest, or a quiet room. Picture yourself there. What do you see? What do you hear? What do you feel? Allow yourself to fully immerse in this peaceful environment.

**Minute 5: Affirmation**
As you continue to breathe, repeat a positive affirmation to yourself. It could be something like, "I am calm and centered," or "I am capable and strong." Repeat this affirmation silently with each breath.

**Minute 6: Gratitude**
Take a moment to think of something you are grateful for. It could be a person, an experience, or something simple like a warm cup of tea. Allow that feeling of gratitude to fill your heart.

**Minute 7: Returning to the Present**
Begin to bring your awareness back to the present moment. Notice the sensations in your body, the sounds around you, and the feeling of the chair or floor beneath you. 

**Minute 8: Deep Breathing**
Take three deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. With each exhale, let go of any remaining tension or stress.

**Minute 9: Gentle Movement**
Gently wiggle your fingers and toes. If it feels good, stretch your arms overhead or roll your shoulders back. 

**Minute 10: Closing**
When you feel ready, slowly open your eyes. Take a moment to notice how you feel. Carry this sense of calm and relaxation with you as you return to your day.
